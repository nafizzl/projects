This file contains an explanation of the app, its intended purpose, and work history. 

Idea: Create a simple local website that acts as a portal for medical patients. 
There's three types of users: 
  - patients, with access to their own info,
  - doctors, with access to their patients' info and possible access to others,
  - admins, with access to all info and handles permission granting

Tools: Flask (Python) back-end API, HTML and CSS for website content and formatting (possibly Javascript front-end later)

This is intended as a "learning project" to help me get used to web development using other frameworks besides depending on HTML and CSS.

10/29/2023 - # Been busy with other things, here's what I added first day back: #
- Created a cycle: homepage -> login -> user page -> homepage
- Adjusted login page, password box has type password now
- Created redirect to login page if entered credentials are wrong
- Started replacing Pandas with MongoDB functionality, specifically PyMongo
- Made database on local MongoDB Compass, made collections with a sample JSON document

10/18/2023 - Imported redirect, url_for, and request. Made simple login page, collected data using HTTP post methods, made some redirect changes depending on what user does 

10/17/2023 - Used boilerplate HTML and CSS templates to structure an example Pandas DataFrame table

10/15/2023 - Tried Flask for the first time, created app file, made example routes, used Blueprint to create and import a file to hold routes
