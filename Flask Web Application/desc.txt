This file contains an explanation of the app, its intended purpose, and work history. 

Idea: Create a simple local website that acts as a portal for medical patients. 
There's three types of users: 
  - patients, with access to their own info,
  - doctors, with access to their patients' info and possible access to others,
  - admins, with access to all info and handles permission granting

Tools: Flask (Python) back-end API, HTML and CSS for website content and formatting (possibly Javascript front-end later)

This is intended as a "learning project" to help me get used to web development using other frameworks besides depending on HTML and CSS.
